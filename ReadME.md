🎯 **Introduction**

In an era where businesses receive massive volumes of emails and documents daily, efficient sorting, prioritization, and routing remain critical challenges. Our hackathon invites tech enthusiasts, developers, and AI innovators to build a Gen AI-powered Orchestrator—a system that intelligently classifies, prioritizes, and routes emails and documents based on context, urgency, and intent.

Our Models will leverage cutting-edge AI models to design solutions that can:

✅ Analyze content to extract key insights and classify emails/documents.

✅ Prioritize based on urgency, sentiment, and business rules.

✅ Route efficiently to the right teams or workflows, reducing manual intervention.

💡 **Inspiration**

The inspiration for this project stems from the growing challenge organizations face in managing vast amounts of incoming emails and documents. In today's fast-paced business environment, teams are overwhelmed with unstructured information, leading to delays, inefficiencies, and missed priorities. Traditional rule-based automation systems struggle to keep up with dynamic workflows, requiring a more intelligent, adaptable solution

⚙️ **What It Does**

The Gen AI Orchestrator is an intelligent system that automates the triage, classification, prioritization, and routing of emails and documents using Generative AI. It enhances workflow efficiency by ensuring the right message reaches the right person at the right time.

🛠️ **How We Built It**

Our Gen AI Orchestrator was built using a combination of advanced AI models, cloud-based automation, and seamless integrations with existing business tools. Here’s a breakdown of the key components and technologies we used:

* AI & NLP Models – OpenAI’s GPT
* Text Processing & Classification - Java Spring Boot
* Email & Document Parsing – Tika apache
* API Integrations – document management tool.


🚧 **Challenges We Faced**

Here are some key obstacles we encountered and how we tackled them:

* Handling Noisy & Unstructured Data
* Ensuring High Accuracy in Classification & Routing
* Balancing Automation & Human Oversight
* Real-Time Processing at Scale
* Integration with Existing Tools & Systems
* Continuous Learning & Model Improvement
